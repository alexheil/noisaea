Hey <%= @fan.fan_name %>,

Congratulations!

You've just joined Noisaea! What are you going to do next?!

If you answered with anything but, "I'm going to follow a boatload of artists!" then you need to think again.

It's super easy to find artists to follow. Use the <%= link_to "discover", artists_url %> page and find artists based on popularity, location, or genre. There's also a search function if you know how to type letters into a box.

Well I'll leave you alone now to... find some artists!

Sincerely,

<%= link_to "Noisaea", root_url %>
