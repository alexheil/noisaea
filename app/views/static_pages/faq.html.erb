    <p class="northrup">Uh, oh. That's not good. Think of all the activity that's happening on your account while you waste your time reading this meaningless sentence when you could have just skipped to the next paragraph and figured it out by now. Ok, sorry.</p>
    <p class="northrup">I'm guessing you either used the wrong email address or you forgot your password. In the second case, you need to <%= link_to "reset your password", new_fan_password_path if fan_signed_in? %><%= link_to "reset your password", new_artist_password_path if artist_signed_in? %><%= link_to "reset your password", new_record_label_password_path if record_label_signed_in? %><%= link_to "reset your password", new_venue_password_path if venue_signed_in? %><%= link_to "reset your password", new_producer_password_path if producer_signed_in? %><%= "reset your password" if !artist_signed_in? && !fan_signed_in? && !record_label_signed_in? && !venue_signed_in? && !producer_signed_in? %>. Click the link and enter the email you that is associated with your account. Confirmation instructions will be sent to you in order to reset and change your password. Once you change your password be sure to tattoo it somewhere on your body for quick reference.</p>
    <p class="northrup">I don't have a way to find user's emails yet, so try not to be so forgetful next time. If you think you've forgotten the email address you signed up with, please <%= link_to "contact", contact_path %> me and I'll get it taken care of for you. Include some sweet information such as your username and artist/fan/record label/venue/producer name.</p>

      <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="northrup">First of all, I'm very sad to see that you want to delete your account. Deeply saddened... alright, I'm over it.</p>
    <p class="northrup">To delete your account, go to your <%= link_to "settings", edit_fan_registration_path if fan_signed_in? %><%= link_to "settings", edit_artist_registration_path if artist_signed_in? %><%= link_to "settings", edit_record_label_registration_path if record_label_signed_in? %><%= link_to "settings", edit_venue_registration_path if venue_signed_in? %><%= link_to "settings", edit_producer_registration_path if producer_signed_in? %><%= "settings" if !artist_signed_in? && !fan_signed_in? && !record_label_signed_in? && !venue_signed_in? && !producer_signed_in? %> and locate the delete button on the bottom of the page. Click it and you'll be prompted to delete your account. Beware, this is permanent and wipes you clean out of the database. No one, not even me, can get your account back.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Good riddance, and don't let the door slam you on the ass on your way out.</p>

      <h3>Some other person is using my name. What the f#$% do I do?</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="northrup"><%= link_to "Contact me", contact_path %> and I will attempt to get in touch with them.</p>
    <p class="northrup">If someone is using your name, and you are, in fact, the official artist/record label/producer/venue behind the name, send proof through <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> by mentioning <a href="https://twitter.com/noisaea">@noisaea</a> with your Twitter handle and I'll get it all set for you.</p>

      <h3>How much will I make?</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="northrup">Right to the good stuff.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Noisaea gets 15% of the final price to stay alive. Stripe takes 3.4% + $.30 per transaction for processing the payment and transfering money. In the end artists make a little more than 81% of the final transaction price.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Example:</p>
    <p class="northrup">You sell a t-shirt for $20 plus $5 shipping, and let's say someone adds $5 to the toal price.</p>
    <p class="northrup">That's $30 total.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Stripe is taking $1.02 plus $.30 for a total of $1.32.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Noisaea gets $4.50.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Total transaction cost is $5.82, leaving $24.18 for the artist.</p>
    <p class="northrup">I believe 15% is a good price for the platform, especailly since we are looking to allow affilates to sell you stuff in the future for 5% of that 15%. Servers are not cheap.</p>

    <div class="highgate">
      <h3>Why do you use Stripe?</h3>
    </div>

    <p class="northrup"><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> is an extremely secure way to take payments over the Internet via debit, credit, bitcoin, Apple Pay, or Andriod Pay. They handle everything from keeping your sensitive information secure to transfering money to our artist's account.</p>
    <p class="northrup">I believe that Stripe is better than PayPal in terms of moving money and keeping accounts secure and active. Many PayPal accounts get shut down for basically no reason (including my own) and I refuse to let that happpen to any of my artists.</p>
    <p class="northrup">We do not store your card information or any other payment information in our database at all. If Noisaea ever gets hacked, you do not.</p>

    <div class="highgate">
      <h3>Why can't fans follow other fans?</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="northrup">The main reason I don't want fans to be able to follow other fans yet is because I want your fan feed to be populated with music related stuff only. Other social media sites mix your favorite artist's post with all of your friends, family, and paraody account's posts as well. noisaea is about the music.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Besides, who cares about your best friend's new baby when Enter Shikari just dropped a new album.</p>
