    <p class="northrup">Noisaea was made for the sole purpose of having fans find artists/record labels/venues/producers that they have never heard of before and be able to keep up with the artists that they already love.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Fans will be able to follow you either through the discover page, your page, or other fan’s pages. Once they follow you, your posts will be added to their fan feed.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Unlike some other social media sites, your posts will be in ALL of your fan’s feeds WITHOUT having to pay. And it will ALWAYS stay like that.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Once you’ve made a sick post, other users will be able to comment and vote on it. Comments are sorted by votes, so all the dumb, idiotic, stupid comments will be at the bottom and the intelligent, inspiring, beautiful comments will be at the top.</p>

      merch
    </div>

    <p class="northrup">Wouldn't it be great if your fans could see everything you have for sale right along with everything else?</p>
    <p class="northrup">I think so, which is why you'll be able to display and sell your shirts, CDs, hoodies, flags, wristbands, records, anything on your page's storefront.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Sell merch right through Noisaea in any major currency and have the funds be deposited directly into your bank account. Noisaea and Stripe processing fees only amount to about 13% of the final price, which means you keep 87%, more than other platforms that do the same.</p>
    <p class="northrup">On Noisaea, U.S. businesses can accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, Discover, and Diners Club. Australian, Canadian, European, and Japanese businesses can accept Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Noisaea also supports Bitcoin, Apple Pay, Android Pay, and China’s Alipay.</p>

      music
    </div>

    <p class="northrup">What would a music site be without the music?</p>
    <p class="northrup">You’ll be able to add albums and tracks to your music page. Fans will be able to purchase full albums or single songs, for a set price or their own price and download them in any format they choose.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Lyrics can be displayed next to the track that’s being played on the playlist.</p>

    <div class="highgate temp">
      shows
    </div>

    <p class="northrup">You’ll be able to list all of your upcoming events by date and be able to sell tickets to each. Eventually you’ll be able to sell tickets directly to your fans.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Fans in the same location of one of your events are able to see the event on their own feed and can choose to purchase a ticket to the event from their own page.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Add flyers, headlining and supporting artists, autolink to venue pages, and descriptions to your events.</p>

    <p class="northrup">Yeah, that's basically what a music video is... it's science!</p>
    <p class="northrup">This page is dedicated to all of your music videos, studio updates, and tour videos. Without that terrible autoplay feature.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Eventually, you'll be able to live stream videos of your shows.</p>

    <div class="highgate temp">
      profile
    </div>

    <p class="northrup">Setting up your profile is the first thing you’re going to want to do after signing up.</p>
    <p class="northrup">Obviously, you want your fans to know a little bit about you. You also want them to be able to find you everywhere, which is why your profile includes links to everything outside of Noisaea, even though Noisaea is the best.</p>
    <p class="northrup">This is also where you’re able to add your location and genre, so future fans can find you through the discover page.</p>

    <p class="northrup">Still can’t find who you’re looking for? Use the search bar at the top of the page.</p>
    <p class="northrup">If there is an artist that you really want to follow, but they aren’t on the site, message them and tell them to sign up!</p>
